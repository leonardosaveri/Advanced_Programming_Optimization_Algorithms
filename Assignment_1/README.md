# Assignment_1_1
Find the optimal solution, determine its objective value, identify the tight constraints and decide whether the optimal solution is unique of:

            min 122x + 143y
      subject to:
              x ≥ -10
              y ≤  10
       3x +  2y ≤  10
      12x + 14y ≥ -12.5
       2x +  3y ≥   3
       5x -  6y ≥-100
       
# Assignment 1_2
Find an optimal mixed strategy of the following game: Both players choose independently a single integer from 1 to 6. Then, the numbers are compared:

  - If they are equal, there is a draw
  - If they differ by 1, the player who played the smaller number gets 2EUR from the other player
  - If they differ by ≥2, the player who played the larger number gets 1EUR from the other player

Note that the game is symmetric and the same strategy is optimal for both players.

# Assignment 1_3
On some imaginary island, there are 69 companies and there are bilateral contracts between them.\
The monarch of the island would like to inspect validity of each of these contracts during a single large event.\
The monarch requires two representatives to represent each contract relationship (they can be both from the same party of the contract or each from a different one).\
This is of course satisfied by each company sending a single representative, which would require involvement of 69 representatives in total.\
However, the companies want to find a solution which minimizes the total number of representatives who need to attend the event.

Input file hw1-03.txt contains information about the contracts. Each line corresponds to a single contract and contains identifiers (1-69) of both involved parties separated by a space.
