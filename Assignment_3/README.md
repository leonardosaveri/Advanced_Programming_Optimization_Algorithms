# LP_Bakery
Code and input of the Bakery Problem from the course in "30553 - Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithms" held by professor Marek Elias at Bocconi University (Spring 2022).

The aim of the project is to, given as an input some pastries, their preparation time, their baking time, and their delivery time, to use an LP Program (using PuLP) to find the times in which to insert each pastry in the oven to minimize the time that the oven is used.
No two pastries can be in the oven in the same time.

After performing the LP program, I got a seires of starting time, and then we had to create a graph (using MatPlotLib) to visualize all the informations that we have.
I attach the graph that I got below.
