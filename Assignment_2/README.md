# Assignment_2
Consider a set of pictures from 360° camera mounted inside a merry-go-round.\
They were taken at night and only one seat is visible which emits light – the seat in the shape of a jelly fish.\
We know that the merry-go-round rotates clockwise and that all the pictures were taken during a single cycle of merry-go-round.\
Given that the first picture is P1, your task is to sort the rest in the chronological order (using Earth-mover distance).\
Assume that the move of jelly fish is monotonous in horizontal direction, i.e., it always moves in clockwise direction, never backwards.
